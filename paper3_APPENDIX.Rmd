#1. Supplementary information about the symbolic elements.

In this section, I provide additional details about the of the EPM's symbols which were used in the experiment (the "real" symbols), as well as on the fictional, "fake", symbols.

##Real symbols

The three EPM symbols which were used in the the experiment are displayed in **Figure A1**. The first element is the unique brand logo of the EPM (image a. in figure A1). This logo consists a pair of green and orange leaves that resemble two hands, designed to symbolize peace and harmony with the environment. The second symbol is the green color, which is strongly associated with taking care of the environment. The EPM's logo and the green color can be seen in almost all of the visual communications of the EPM, and they represent key elements of its unique "visual identity". The third element is celebrity endorsements. I selected two high-profile celebrity comedians, *Tal Friedman* and *Ido Rosenblum*, that previously endorsed two salient advertising campaigns of the EPM. The campaign starring the comedian Tal Friedman (image b.) was launched in 2010, and included a series of advertisements in which Friedman was presented with a green grass head, and accordingly the campaign's slogan was: "starting to think green". The campaign starring the comedian Ido Rosenblum (image c.) was launched in 2017, and was focused on reducing the use of disposable bags. The two campaigns were highly successful in terms of their recognizability and likability, as suggested by their evaluation reports by the Government advertising agency.[^footnote_lapam_reports] The campaign images were downloaded from EPM's website, and thereafter were cropped, to remove any text (via GIMP software).

##Fake symbols

The fake symbols were specifically designed to represent graphical elements that resemble the look and aesthetic qualities of the familiar EPM symbols, as much as possible, while removing their symbolic aspects (i.e. without activating emotions and associations which can be attached to the government ministry and environmental issues). Accordingly, the green color is replaced with blue, the EPM logo is replaced by a fake logo and the images of celebrities from the campaigns are replaced with two edited images of unfamiliar people. 

The fake logo was created via MS paint software. I replaced the leaves/hands from the original logo with a shape of stars with rounded edges, and replaced the green color with blue. I deliberately selected a natural element - star - as opposed to an abstract geometric element, since marketing studies have pointed to the "naturalness" of logos, as one of the key aesthetic characteristics rendering logos more memorable and favorable [@henderson_1998]. 

To create the fake campaign images, I searched for photos of unfamiliar male models that resemble the look of the real endorsers, Tal Friedman and Ido Rosenblum, and their face expressions in the campaign images. For this purpose, I used the website www.istockphoto.com that offers multiple collections of professional images for purchase.[^footnote_sources_fake_models] Thereafter, I took these images of models, and edited them (via GIMP software) to create images which are aesthetically similar to the original campaign images, yet without their symbolic aspects. For the recycling policy, I used the same image from EPM's reusable bags campaign, while replacing Rosenblum's face with the face of the unfamiliar model, and changing the color of the bag from green to blue. For the The Air-pollution policy, I took the purchased image of the unfamiliar model, and added a blue rectangle behind him (instead of the green background behind Friedman). I also added a blue geometric shape above the person's head, which I took from a logo of an Israeli mortgage bank, against Friedman's green hair. The latter addition was important, given that the green hair not only has a symbolic connotation, but also functions as an unusual, surprising element, that attracts people's attention. The original and edited photos are displayed below:

#2. Manipulation and validity checks

In this section, I report the results of manipulation checks for the symbols and relevance manipulations. In addition, I report the results of additional analyses regarding the empirical assumptions underlying the comparison between the two areas. These analyses are based on the survey data, and on two prior surveys, as described below. 

## Symbols manipulation

In two prior surveys, I confirmed that the real EPM symbols are recognizable and have a positive affect, whereas the fake logo is unrecognizable, do not have strong positive or negative affect, and are not strongly associated with environment policy and EPM. 

The first prior survey was conducted on May 2017 among `r SVIVA1_01 %>% nrow()` participants, which were recruited by iPanel. This survey was designed as a survey experiment, which was a first attempt to test the moderating role of personal relevance on the effects of symbols and information. However, after analyzing the results, I came to the conclusion that the experimental procedure had several methodological problems. Mainly, the assignment to experimental conditions yielded imbalanced groups, and the manipulations of symbolic elements and information ware too subtle. In addition, perceived personal relevance was measured only through the comparison between the areas (i.e. without the relevance manipulation), and the information was manipulated only with regard to the air-pollution policy. Despite these weaknesses, the survey included specific questions about the affect and symbolic associations of the logos and the colors, which provide valuable descriptive data.[^footnote_prior_survey_1] In this survey, the participants were assigned to one of three conditions of symbols: real symbols, fake symbols and no symbols. The real and fake symbols conditions included the same logos and colors which were eventually used in the final experiment (but not the campaign images). At the end of the survey, participants were asked about their familiarity with the logos and colors that appeared in their policy plans, and their affect. These items and their descriptive results are presented below. 

[^footnote_prior_survey_1]: Overall, the findings of this limited prior study are consistent Consistent with the findings of the main experiment, reported in the paper. The effect of the real symbols were greater among those who reside in the Haifa-Bay. Congruently, the statistical analyses yielded a negative and significant interaction between the real symbols and residence in the center. Also consistent with the main experiment, the interaction between the areas and the information manipulation was not significant.  


"How familiar are you with the symbol [that appeared in the policy plans]?" (1=not at all; 7=very much)

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%'),fig.show='hold', fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
set_theme("scatterw")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA1_01,SYMBOL==2)$SVIVA_LOGO_recognize,
        geom.size = 0.9,
        ylim=c(0,155),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Real logo")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA1_01,FAKE_LOGO_recognize!=0)$FAKE_LOGO_recognize,
        geom.size = 0.9,
        ylim=c(0,155),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Fake logo")

```


"When you see the symbol [that appeared in the policy plans], what does it make you feel?" (1=very negative feeling; 7=very positive feeling)

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%'),fig.show='hold', fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
set_theme("scatterw")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA1_01,SYMBOL==2)$SVIVA_LOGO_affect,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,160),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Real logo")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA1_01,FAKE_LOGO_recognize!=0)$FAKE_LOGO_affect,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,160),
        axis.title="",
       title = "Fake logo")

```


Overall, these results show that the real logo is relatively recognizable and has a fairly positive affect, whereas the fake logo is unrecognized and neutral. Participants were also asked "What is the first thought / association that comes to mind when you see the symbol?"  With regard to the real logo, many of the participants filled associations related to carting for the environment. Representative examples for such answers are: "environmental protection", "a desire to protect nature and the environment", "green policy", "together for the sake of nature", "connection between nature and man". The participants were similarly asked about the first thought / association that comes to their mind when they see the color. Representative answers for the green color were: "nature", "a green and healthy environment", "environment protection". The responses for the fake logo and the blue color were more diverse, and mostly unrelated to environmental issues. 

The second prior survey was conducted on January 2018 among `r CELEBS_00%>%nrow()` participants, which were similarly recruited via iPanel. This survey was designed as a pre-test that was aimed at assessing the recognizability, affect and associations of the real vs. fake campaign images. Participants were presented with the four campaign images (two real and two fake), in a random order. After every image, they were asked a series of questions regarding the familiarity and affect of the image and of the person presented. The items and their descriptive results are presented below.

```


These results similarly show that the real campaign images are relatively recognizable and have a fairly positive affect, whereas the fake images and models are unrecognized and do not evoke strong negative of positive feelings. Finally, I similarly asked subjects to describe their first thoughts/associations regarding the images of Friedman and Rosenblum from their campaigns (without any text). Most of the participants associated Rosenblum's image to the reducing the use of disposable grocery bags, in line with the campaign's message (e.g. "reusable bag", "reusable instead of disposable bag for protecting the environment"). With regard to Friedman's grass-head image from his "starting to think green" campaign, participants mostly mentioned associations related to environmental awareness (e.g. "green head, thinking about the environment", "green environment", "think green"), and to the humoristic aspect (e.g. "funny", "comedian", "Funny advertisement", "hahaha"). 

<br>

## Areas: Haifa-Bay vs. Center

To confirm the assumption that the Air-pollution policy is perceived as more personally relevant by Haifa-Bay subjects, whereas the recycling policy is perceived as equally relevant by both groups, I relied on the following question, which was included in the survey, regarding both policy plans: 

"To what extent did you feel that the policy on ["Reducing the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay" / “reducing waste and increasing recycling”] is personally relevant to you?" (1="very little"; 7="very much").

The distribution of this variable for the two policies, across the two areas, is displayed in the following plots. These comparisons confirm the assumption.   

Air-pollution policy

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%'),fig.show='hold', fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA2_01_comb,AREA==0)$RELEVANCE_air_obs,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,600),xlim=c(0.5,7.5),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Center")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA2_01_comb,AREA==1)$RELEVANCE_air_obs,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,600),xlim=c(0.5,7.5),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Haifa-bay")

```

Recycling policy

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%'),fig.show='hold', fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA2_01_comb,AREA==0)$RELEVANCE_waste_obs,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,600),xlim=c(0.5,7.5),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Center")

sjp.frq(filter(SVIVA2_01_comb,AREA==1)$RELEVANCE_waste_obs,
        type="hist",
        show.mean = T,
        ylim=c(0,600),xlim=c(0.5,7.5),
        axis.title="",
        title = "Haifa-bay")

```


I also examined the assumption that Haifa-bay subjects do not have greater knowledge on the air-pollution in their area issue, compared with the participants who reside in the Center. To test that assumption I relied on three incdicators. First, I assessed participants prior knowledge about the causes of the phenomenon. Participants were given a list of causes and were asked to rank them based on their contribution to air-pollution. There were no significant differences between the two samples for this task. Additionally, I assessed participants knowledge of the effectiveness of the Ministry’s previous policy by asking participants whether air-pollution has increased, decreased, or remained the same during the past years. Haifa-bay residents were only slightly more likley to indicate correctly that it had decreased according to EPM reports (`r filter(SVIVA1_01,AREA==1)%>%summarise(mean(HAIFA_knowledge_2)*100)%>%max()%>%round(0)`% compared with `r filter(SVIVA1_01,AREA==0)%>%summarise(mean(HAIFA_knowledge_2)*100)%>%max()%>%round(0)`%). Still, even among Haifa-bay subjects, the vast majority of subjects were incorrect.


<br>

## Relevance manipulation

I tested whether the priming questions in the relevance treatment condition increased the perceived personal relevance of the two policy plans. For this purpose, I relied on the following question, which was included in the survey, regarding both policy plans: 

"To what extent did you feel that the policy on ["Reducing the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay" / “reducing waste and increasing recycling”] is personally relevant to you?" (1="very little"; 7="very much").

I analyze the effect of the relevance manipulation, across the two areas, on this variable, via OLS regression. Table AX shows the results of these regression analyses. For each of the two policy plans, I first regress perceived personal relevance on the relevance treatment and the areas, and thereafer I add their interaction. Counter to my expectations, the relevance manipulation did not have a positive main effect on either of these two policy plans. In Model 2, the interaction between the relevance treatment and the center area is positive and significant and the coefficient of the relevance treatment is negative and significant. The interpretation of this interaction model suggests that the priming questions had a negative effect on Haifa-Bay subjects, and a positive effect on those who reside in the Center. Regarding the recycling policy, the interaction is insignificant in Model 4.

In the tables below, I report the results of additional robust analyses testing the moderating role of the perceived personal relevance of the communications. In **Table A3** I analyze subjects' subjective reporting on the personal relevance of each of the two policy plans, and its interaction with the symbols and information manipulations, controlling for the areas. These analyses show that higher scores of perceived personal relevance did not attentuate the positive effect of the real symbols. However, in line with Hypothesis 2, it did slightly increase the effect of the weak information with regard to the air-pollution policy.

In **Tables A4 - A6**, I examine the effects of relevance treatment and the differences between the areas on subjects elaboration of the two policy plans, using three additional measures. The first measure is the number of seconds participants spent on scanning the policy plans, log transformed (hereafter: reaction time). The second measure is participants' score in a memory test, which was conducted during the survey. Participants were asked to indicate whether a list of four items were included in the second policy plan which was presented to them, of which two were/were not included (participants could also select “I don’t know”). The memory score is calculated as the number of correct items selected by the participant minus the number of incorrect items, with a minimum score of zero. Accordingly, participants could receive the scores of 0, 1 or 2. The third measure is the delta between trust in the strong and weak policy plans presented to each subject. This within-subject analysis utilizes the research design in which every participant was presented with one weak and one strong policies. Neither residing in the Haifa-bay nor the relevance treatment increase the elaboration of policy plans, based on these three measures.  

In **Tables A7 and A8**, I replicate the main analyses while adding additional control variables. In Tables A7, I control for demographics and additional individual-level covariates, including ideology and trust in government ministries in general. In Table A8 I further control for factors that can be related to participants' motivation to elaborate, including having young children, general interest in environmental issues and following environmental issues in the media. The two final variables are based on survey items which were presented only to those subjects assigned to the relevance treatment condition, and therefore, their analysis is based only on that sample (n = `r SVIVA2_01 %>% filter(RELEVANCE_exp==1) %>% nrow()`).Finally, in **Table A9**, I add those subjects who were filttered, except for those who are under the age of 18 (n_subjects = `r SVIVA2_comb_robust_1 %>%distinct(IP) %>% nrow()`). In all these analyses, the effects of the symbols and information manipulations and their interaction with the areas and the relevance manipulation are consistent with the main models.

**Thank you very much for participating in the study. Some of the policy programs presented to you during the questionnaire included content that was different from the original work plan or was presented differently. The tasks related to "raising awareness" and "reducing supervision" are invented tasks that are not part of the Ministry of Environmental Protection's policy. [For the fake symbols: In addition, the pictures of the people presented in the programs were not taken from the ministry's broadcasts, and their characters were used only for research purposes.]**

**You may review the original policies of the Environmental Protection Ministry regarding the policy issues which were presented at the website of government work plans: plans.gov.il and at the Ministry's website: sviva.gov.il.**
