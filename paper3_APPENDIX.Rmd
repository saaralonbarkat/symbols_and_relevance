#1. Supplementary information about the symbolic elements.

In this section, I provide additional details about the creation of the "real" and "fake" symbolic elements that were included in the policy plans in the survey. 

##Real symbols

The campaign images which were included in the policy plans in the real symbols condition were downloaded from EPM's official website (http://www.sviva.gov.il), from the section that archives the Ministry's publications and public campaigns. After downloading the images, I cropped them (via GIMP software). The sources of the images are detailed below:

**Air-pollution policy**

Campaign name: "Starting to think green"; Endorser: Tal Friedman.

Source: http://www.sviva.gov.il/InfoServices/ReservoirInfo/ResearchAndPublications/Pages/Publications/P0601-P0700/P0641.aspx

**Recycling policy**

Campaign name: "From now on, every bag is taken seriously"; Endorser: Ido Rosenblum.

Source: http://www.sviva.gov.il/InfoServices/NewsAndEvents/MessageDoverAndNews/Pages/2016/December2016/plastic-bags-campaign-2016-IR.aspx

<br>

##Fake symbols

The fake logo and campaign images were specifically designed to represent graphical elements that resemble the look and aesthetic qualities of the real symbolic elements, as much as possible, while removing their symbolic aspects. 

The fake logo was created via MS paint software. I replaced the leaves/hands from the original logo with a shape of stars with rounded edges, and replaced the green color with blue. I deliberately selected a natural element - star - as opposed to an abstract geometric element, since marketing studies have pointed to the "naturalness" of logos, as one of the key aesthetic characteristics rendering logos more memorable and favorable [@henderson_1998]. 

To create the fake campaign images, I searched for photos of unfamiliar male models that resemble the look of the real endorsers, Tal Friedman and Ido Rosenblum, and their face expressions in the campaign images. For this purpose, I used the website www.istockphoto.com that offers multiple collections of professional images for purchase. The original photos which I purchased from the website, and their sources are detailed below. Thereafter, I took these images of models, and edited them (via GIMP software) to create images which are aesthetically similar to the original campaign images, yet without their symbolic aspects. For the recycling policy, I used the same image from EPM's reusable bags campaign, while replacing Rosenblum's face with the face of the unfamiliar model, and changing the color of the bag from green to blue. For the The Air-pollution policy, I took the purchased image of the unfamiliar model, and added a blue rectangle behind him (instead of the green background behind Friedman). I also added a blue geometric shape above the person's head, which I took from a logo of an Israeli mortgage bank, against Friedman's green hair. The latter addition was important, given that the green hair not only has a symbolic connotation, but also functions as an unusual, surprising element, that attracts people's attention.

#5. English translation of the survey experiment

Below is the full text of the survey. Additional comments are presented in square beackets. The different experimental conditions of the two policy plans are included in the appendix of the main paper, and therefore were not included here. The original Qualtrics file is available upon request. 



**Greetings,** 

**We are researchers from the Department of Political Science at the Hebrew University. The short questionnaire below is part of an academic study designed to teach us about the attitudes of Israeli citizens regarding environmental policy. Therefore, it is important for us that you answer the questionnaire seriously and honestly. The questionnaire filling time is about 5-10 minutes.**

**Thank you very much for participating in the study. Some of the policy programs presented to you during the questionnaire included content that was different from the original work plan or was presented differently. The tasks related to "raising awareness" and "reducing supervision" are invented tasks that are not part of the Ministry of Environmental Protection's policy. [For the fake symbols: In addition, the pictures of the people presented in the programs were not taken from the ministry's broadcasts, and their characters were used only for research purposes.]**

**You may review the original policies of the Environmental Protection Ministry regarding the policy issues which were presented at the website of government work plans: plans.gov.il and at the Ministry's website: sviva.gov.il.**
