# Abstract

*Previous public administration studies have examined whether public communications can affect citizens trust in government organizations and their policies. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that these communications can enhance trust not only by conveying substantive information, but also by incorporating strategically desigened symbolic element that evoke positive feelings and associations (e.g. logos, images and celebrities). Still, under which conditions are citizens more/less likely to be emotionally persuaded by these symbols? Building on the social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), I theorize that citizens are less susceptible to symbols when they perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves, which enhances their motivation to invest in elaborate processing. I put this theory to test through a survey experiment, where I examine circa `r SVIVA2_01%>%nrow()%>%round(-1)` Israeli citizens' trust in the Environment Protection Ministry's policies for reducing the air pollution in a specific area (the Haifa-Bay) and reducing domestic waste. I operationalize personal relevance both experimentally, and by comparing between citizens from the polluted Haifa-Bay area and others. The experimental results do not support the hypothesis that higher personal relevance attenuates the effect of symbols. They tentatively suggest that symbols are more likely to persuade citizens who have predominant negative attitudes.*

# Introduction

Public administration scholars have explored whether government organizations can enhance citizens' trust in them by employing public communications. Whereas most of the studies on the effect of government public communications on citizens attitudes has focused on the *informative* aspects of these communications [e.g. @marvel_2015; @im_2014; @porumbescu_2017; @porumbescu_2016; @porumbescu_2017a; @porumbescu_2017b; @grimmelikhuijsen_2015; @ho_2017], recent experimental studies further pointed to the emotive effect of *symbolic* elements that are entangled in government communications, such as  agencies' names [@teodoro_2018], brand logos [@karens_2016], and figures in public campaigns [@alonbarkat_2017]. These studies demonstrated that these familiar and well-designed symbolic elements can enhance citizens' trust irratioanlly through a mechanism of "evaluative conditioning" - unconscious transfer of affect from the symbols to the public organizations and policies associated with them [@dehouwer_2012]. 

While the abovementioned studies have substantiated the distinct effect of symbols, they did not theorize, nor empirically examine the conditions under which are these symbols are likely to be more/less effective in persuading citizens. The research gap has great significance. From the organizations' practical point of view, ... 

Employing a broader, democratic normative stance, we should be also concerned from the effect of symbols. Symbolic elements can elicit undue trust in poorly performing organizations and in ill-conceived policies. Accordingly, it may enable public organizations to escape justified public criticism [@alonbarkat_2017]. Hence, by understanding when citizens are more likely to be affected by symbols, we  may enable us to identify the  

Therefore, this study focuses on the following questions: *What are the psychological mechanisms by which symbolic elements in governemnt communications affect citizens' trust in government organizations and their policies?* Accordingly, *under what conditions do symbolic elements  increase citizens' trust in governemnt policy?* And specifically, *does the effect of symbolic elements depend on the substantive content of communications?* *Do symbols offset the rational, negative effect of unfavorable or logically unpersuasive information?* 

To address these research questions, I draw upon the social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). ELM provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for the varying psychological processes underlying individuals' responses to persuasive communication, and their consequences for attitude change  [@petty_1986; @petty_2011]. Based on ELM, I suggest that symbolic elements in public communications can affect citizens' trust via two mechanisms: *First*, they may evoke positive feelings and associations that are transferred from the symbols to the relevant government entities and policies, and thereby increase citizens' trust in them. I expect that this effect is attenuated the more citizens perceive the communications as personally relevant, because they are more motivated to think about their messages. *Second*, symbolic elements may increase citizens' trust in government entities and policies by causing them to disregard negative of logically unpersuasive content that would have otherwise decreased their trust.  

To empirically test these theoretical expectations, I conducted a large randomized survey experiment among circa `r SVIVA2_01%>%nrow() %>% round(-1)` Israeli citizens. The experiment focuses on the empirical case of the Israeli Environment Protection Ministry. I explore citizens' responses to public communications about two policy plans of the Ministry, and specifically the extent to which their trust in these policies are affected by the substantive information of the communications (logically persuasive vs. unpersuasive policy plans) and by symbolic elements in them (real symbols vs. fake symbols and no symbols conditions). In addition, I examine the moderating role of the perceived personal relevance of these policies. 

I find that the symbolic elements increased citizens' trust in these policies. In line with my theoretical expectations, the effect was greater among those who saw the logically unpersuasive policy plans, who were distracted by the symbols and thus were less inclined to think about its content. I did not find support for the hypothesis that the effect of the symbolic elements is attenuated by the perceived personal relevance of the policy issue. I discuss the theoretical and normative implications of these findings.

# The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the effect of symbols and information in communicaions. 

The social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for investigating peoples' varying responses to "persuasive" 
<br>


# The moderating role of perceived personal relevance on citizens' responses to symbols and information in communications

How may we apply the theoretical framework of ELM to the study of the effects of symbolic elements in government communications with citizens and their interaction with substantive information?


In sum, I expect that:  

>*H<sub>1</sub> - Symbolic elements in public organizations' communications are likely to increase citizens' trust in the organizations and in the policies presented in the communications.* 

>*H<sub>2</sub> - The positive effect of symbolic elements on citizens' trust is likely to be enhanced when the communication includes negative or logically unpersuasive information that would have decreased citizens' trust.*

>*H<sub>3</sub> - Symbolic elements are likely to decrease the amount of thinking about the content of the communication.*

>*H<sub>4</sub> - The abovementioned conditioned effect of symbolic elements on citizens' trust is likely to be mediated by the decrease in the amount of thinking (a moderated mediation hypothesis).*

##Appendix A: Information manipulation

**Air-pollution policy** (Reducing the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay)

EPM is working to reduce the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay through: 

*Strong*

* **Increasing the supervision of the factories in Haifa-Bay**.
In order to reduce the emissions of pollutants from the factories in the industrial area, the Ministry is working to increase the supervision of the factories in several ways. The ministry will increase the number of inspection visits, expand the use of unannounced inspections, and increase the amount of fines for pollutants.

* **Reduction of smoke emissions from vehicles in Haifa Bay**.
The Ministry is taking a number of actions to reduce the amount of air-pollution from vehicles in the area. The ministry promotes the installation of particle filters in hundreds of vehicles in the area, and promotes the operation of a "clean-air area" that restricts the entry of polluting vehicles.

*Weak*

* **Decreasing the supervision of the factories in Haifa-Bay**.
The Ministry is preparing for a change in the method of supervision of the factories. The ministry will reduce the number of inspection visits and unannounced inspections, rely on factories' self-reports on pollutant emissions, and reduce the amount of fines. The change is coordinated with members of the industry, which are committed to reducing the pollution, and it will assist to build mutual respect between them and the ministry.

* **Raising citizens' awareness of the efforts to improve air quality**.
In recent years, the Ministry has taken steps to reduce air pollution in Haifa-Bay, which have been partially successful. The Ministry is working to raise awareness of its efforts and to emphasize their success in order to improve its image among the residents. To this end, the ministry has increased its investment in public relations and publicity in this subject.

<br>

**Recycling policy** (Reducing waste and increasing recycling)

EPM is working to reduce the amount of waste and increase its recycling through:

*Strong*

* **Packaging recycling - Increased supervision of manufacturers**.
In order to reduce the amount of waste generated from packaging and to encourage recycling, the Ministry implements the Packaging act, which imposes on manufacturers and importers the responsibility for recycling the packaging. The Ministry will work to increase enforcement by virtue of this act, and will enforce it with regard to additional manufacturers and importers.

* **Reducing the usage of disposable bags**.
In order to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags, the Ministry enforces the Bags act, which sets a compulsory charge on bags sold in large retail chains and imposes reporting obligations on the chains. The Ministry works to implement the act, and encourages the transition to reusable grocery bags.

*Weak*

* **Packaging recycling - Decreased supervision of manufacturers**.
The Ministry is preparing to a change in the method of supervision of the manufacturers, who are responsible for the recycling of product packaging by virtue of the act The ministry will reduce the number of inspections, rely on manufacturers' self-reports regarding their compliance with the requirements of the act, and reduce the amount of fines. The change is coordinated with members of the industry, which are committed to the issue, and it will assist to strengthen mutual respect between them and the ministry.

* **Reducing the usage of disposable bags**.
In recent years, the Ministry has taken steps to encourage the reduction of waste, which have been partially successful. The Ministry works to raise awareness of the actions taken and to highlight their success in order to improve its image among the public. To this end, the ministry has increased its investment in public relations and publicity in this subject.
