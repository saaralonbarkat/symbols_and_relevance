# Abstract

*Previous public administration studies have examined whether public communications can affect citizens trust in government organizations and their policies. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that these communications can enhance trust not only by conveying substantive information, but also by incorporating strategically desigened symbolic element that evoke positive feelings and associations (e.g. logos, images and celebrities). Still, under which conditions are citizens more/less likely to be emotionally persuaded by these symbols? Building on the social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), I theorize that citizens are less susceptible to symbols when they perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves, which enhances their motivation to invest in elaborate processing. I put this theory to test through a survey experiment, where I examine circa `r SVIVA2_01%>%nrow()%>%round(-1)` Israeli citizens' trust in the Environment Protection Ministry's policy plans for reducing the air pollution in a specific area (the Haifa-Bay) and reducing domestic waste. I operationalize personal relevance both experimentally, and by comparing between citizens from the polluted Haifa-Bay area and others. The experimental results do not support the hypothesis that higher personal relevance attenuates the effect of symbols. They tentatively suggest that symbols are more likely to persuade citizens who have predominant negative attitudes.*

# Introduction

Public administration scholars have explored whether government organizations can enhance citizens' trust in them by employing public communications. Whereas most of the studies on the effect of government public communications on citizens attitudes has focused on the *informative* aspects of these communications [e.g. @marvel_2015; @im_2014; @porumbescu_2017; @porumbescu_2016; @porumbescu_2017a; @porumbescu_2017b; @grimmelikhuijsen_2015; @ho_2017], recent experimental studies further pointed to the emotive effect of *symbolic* elements that are entangled in government communications, such as  agencies' names [@teodoro_2018], brand logos [@karens_2016], and figures in public campaigns [@alonbarkat_2017]. These studies demonstrated that these familiar and well-designed symbolic elements can enhance citizens' trust irratioanlly through a mechanism of "evaluative conditioning" - unconscious transfer of affect from the symbols to the public organizations and policies associated with them [@dehouwer_2012]. 

While the abovementioned studies have substantiated the distinct effect of symbols, they did not theorize, nor they empirically examined the conditions under which are these symbols are likely to be more/less effective in persuading citizens. This research gap has great significance. From the practical point of view of public organizations, this may enable them to design more effective communications which may enhance citizens' collaboration with their policies. Employing a broader perspective of normative democratic theory, the emotive effect of symbols can be perceived as problematic. It stands in tension with the normative expectation that citizens' judgments should be based on their critical thinking. Morover, as argued by @alonbarkat_2017, symbolic communication may elicit undue trust in poorly performing organizations, and enable public organizations to escape justified public criticism. Hence, by understanding when citizens are more/less likely to be affected by symbols, we may be able to better assess the potential risk for governments' manipulative use of symbolic communications.  

To address this literature gap, I draw upon the social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) [@petty_1986; @petty_2011]. I hypothesize that citizens are less susceptible to symbols the more they perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves, which enhances their motivation to invest in elaborate processing. Similarly, higher perceived personal relevance are expected to enhance citizens' inclincation to scrutinize the substantive content of communication. Employing a survey experiment, I test this hypothesis in the context of the Israeli Environment Protection Ministry, and its policy plans for reducing the air pollution in a specific area (the Haifa-Bay) and for reducing domestic waste. I operationalize personal relevance both experimentally, and by comparing between citizens from the polluted Haifa-Bay area and others.

# The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the effect of symbols and information in communicaions. 

The social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for investigating peoples' varying responses to "persuasive" 
<br>


# The moderating role of perceived personal relevance on citizens' responses to symbols and information in communications

How may we apply the theoretical framework of ELM to the study of the effects of symbolic elements in government communications with citizens and their interaction with substantive information?


In sum, I expect that:  

*H<sub>1</sub> - Symbolic elements in communications are less (more) likely to increase citizens' trust in governemnt organizations and policicies, the more (less) citizens perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves.*

*H<sub>2</sub> - The logical quality of the communication is more (less) likely to affect citizens' trust in governemnt organizations and policicies, the more (less) citizens perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves.*

The theoretical hypotheses are graphically displayed in **Figure 1**.

##Appendix A: Information manipulation

**Air-pollution policy** (Reducing the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay)

EPM is working to reduce the air-pollution in the Haifa-Bay through: 

*Strong*

* **Increasing the supervision of the factories in Haifa-Bay**.
In order to reduce the emissions of pollutants from the factories in the industrial area, the Ministry is working to increase the supervision of the factories in several ways. The ministry will increase the number of inspection visits, expand the use of unannounced inspections, and increase the amount of fines for pollutants.

* **Reduction of smoke emissions from vehicles in Haifa Bay**.
The Ministry is taking a number of actions to reduce the amount of air-pollution from vehicles in the area. The ministry promotes the installation of particle filters in hundreds of vehicles in the area, and promotes the operation of a "clean-air area" that restricts the entry of polluting vehicles.

*Weak*

* **Decreasing the supervision of the factories in Haifa-Bay**.
The Ministry is preparing for a change in the method of supervision of the factories. The ministry will reduce the number of inspection visits and unannounced inspections, rely on factories' self-reports on pollutant emissions, and reduce the amount of fines. The change is coordinated with members of the industry, which are committed to reducing the pollution, and it will assist to build mutual respect between them and the ministry.

* **Raising citizens' awareness of the efforts to improve air quality**.
In recent years, the Ministry has taken steps to reduce air pollution in Haifa-Bay, which have been partially successful. The Ministry is working to raise awareness of its efforts and to emphasize their success in order to improve its image among the residents. To this end, the ministry has increased its investment in public relations and publicity in this subject.

<br>

**Recycling policy** (Reducing waste and increasing recycling)

EPM is working to reduce the amount of waste and increase its recycling through:

*Strong*

* **Packaging recycling - Increased supervision of manufacturers**.
In order to reduce the amount of waste generated from packaging and to encourage recycling, the Ministry implements the Packaging act, which imposes on manufacturers and importers the responsibility for recycling the packaging. The Ministry will work to increase enforcement by virtue of this act, and will enforce it with regard to additional manufacturers and importers.

* **Reducing the usage of disposable bags**.
In order to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags, the Ministry enforces the Bags act, which sets a compulsory charge on bags sold in large retail chains and imposes reporting obligations on the chains. The Ministry works to implement the act, and encourages the transition to reusable grocery bags.

*Weak*

* **Packaging recycling - Decreased supervision of manufacturers**.
The Ministry is preparing to a change in the method of supervision of the manufacturers, who are responsible for the recycling of product packaging by virtue of the act The ministry will reduce the number of inspections, rely on manufacturers' self-reports regarding their compliance with the requirements of the act, and reduce the amount of fines. The change is coordinated with members of the industry, which are committed to the issue, and it will assist to strengthen mutual respect between them and the ministry.

* **Reducing the usage of disposable bags**.
In recent years, the Ministry has taken steps to encourage the reduction of waste, which have been partially successful. The Ministry works to raise awareness of the actions taken and to highlight their success in order to improve its image among the public. To this end, the ministry has increased its investment in public relations and publicity in this subject.
